# Project 3: Pizza

## Objectives

* Become more comfortable with Django.
* Gain experience with relational database design.

## Overview

In this project, you’ll build an web application for handling a pizza restaurant’s online orders. Users will be able to browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders. Meanwhile, the restaurant owners will be able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed.

## Milestones

We recommend that you try to meet the following milestones in order:

* Complete the Menu, Adding Items, and Registration/Login/Logout steps.
* Complete the Shopping Cart and Placing an Order steps.
* Complete the Viewing Orders and Personal Touch steps.

## Getting Started

### Python and Django
As with Projects 1 and 2, make sure that you have a copy of Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You’ll also need to install `pip`. If you downloaded Python from Python’s website, you likely already have pip installed (you can check by running pip in a terminal window). If you don’t have it installed, be sure to install it before moving on!

To run this Django application:
* In a terminal window, navigate into your `project3` directory. Note that this is the directory for a Django project called `pizza`.
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python manage.py runserver`
