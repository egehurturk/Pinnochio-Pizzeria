Common Error: ... has no attribute  _meta (That is because of django's serializers, use serializers to only serialize queries
                                            not strings or other types.)
------ Date: 07/13/2020 ------
When returning a JsonResponse view, do not include both the large_price or small_price, include the one
client wanted (which is the size variable).
You can do something like if else statement to achiveve this.
