# FIXME: I created 2 same menu items for items that has `small_price` and `large_price`. While rendering the HTML (menu.html), integrate those 2 menu Items into one displaying LARGE and SMALL prices.
With menu items that does not have small/large prices, it is OK
# TODO: Design of Menu Items
# TODO: Refactor the AJAX in app.js and turn into jQuery AJAX.
# TODO: Work on the showcart view on orders.views. That view must return a JsonResponse object and parse in javascript.

Snippet:
`mylist = [Sub.objects.all()]
appemd = [i for i in mylist]
small = []
large = []
for i,j in enumerate(appemd):
  if j%2==0:
    small.append(j.price)
  else:
    large.append(j.price)
    
for sm, lg in zip(small, large):
  print(f'{sm} {lg}')`
  
Or instead of doing this way, alter model Item to have small prices and large prices fields.
