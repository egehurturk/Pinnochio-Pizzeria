# FIXME: I created 2 same menu items for items that has `small_price` and `large_price`. While rendering the HTML (menu.html), integrate those 2 menu Items into one displaying LARGE and SMALL prices.
With menu items that does not have small/large prices, it is OK
# TODO: Design of Menu Items
# TODO: Refactor the AJAX in app.js and turn into jQuery AJAX.
# TODO: Work on the showcart view on orders.views. That view must return a JsonResponse object and parse in javascript.
